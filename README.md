# mapping-with-L515
Internship project: mapping part for SLAM with Intel RealSense lidar camera L515. Examples code is the edited [official examples folder](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master/wrappers/python/examples/ethernet_client_server).

Further work will be done with another camera, that is still supported.
